                     <p>The ALARD Group of Institutes was established, under the dynamic leadership of Dr. L.R. Yadav with an objective to provide quality management education fulfilling the needs of the corporate world in the 21st century.</p>
                     <p>ALARD is an acronym, which stands for <span>A</span>ttitude, <span>L</span>eadership, <span>A</span>lertness, <span>R</span>eadiness and <spDn>D</spDn>edication. The institute steadfastly stands by these chosen core values in the ethos of the institute’s various aspects; be it academics, learning, application, working and playing together on campus. This instills a very strong value-system in the students’ psyche, which helps them perform better not only when they are learners at this institute, but also when they graduate and go into the real world as responsible citizens.</p>

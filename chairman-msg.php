                    <p>From being a part of agriculture family in a small village of Aghaw district Deoria (U.P) has never affected my dreams of becoming a successful entrepreneur. My vision was always cleared of contributing a huge in the field of education and academics. After my schooling education, I shifted to Pune for higher education and then joined hands in my family business which was since <b>1968</b> and expanded the ALARD Group.</p>
                    <p>It was <b>1988</b>, when I laid the foundation of ALARD Industries Ltd. and set up the manufacturing unit for machinery for sugar, cement and power plants. Impressively, the company has executed a lot of prestigious projects in Sugar Industries, Chemical Industries, Power Generation Plants, etc.</p>
                    <p>The zest of building a better nation uplifted me to establish reputed education Institutes in Pune which is focused on professional and higher education in<b> engineering, Management, Pharmacy, Law, Medical Education, and Schools.</b></p>
                    <p>Being The Founder Chairman and Managing Trustee of ALARD, it’s my responsibility to provide the best education to my students. <b>ALARD has achieved a lot yet we need to continue to take a bigger leap.</b></p>
